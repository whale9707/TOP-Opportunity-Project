# TrendR
Greetings! We are the core team members for **The Opportunity Project**.

Our team built a data product that enables the community organizations with varying degrees of statistical and technical expertise to utilize Census Decennial Data to make well-informed and data-driven decisions based on trends.
We achieved so with a R Shiny Dashboard.

### Objective
This dashboard serves as a minimum viable product that allows the user to draw actionable insights and easily navigate the data. For the Census Bureau Data Sprint Challenge, our team decided to narrow down our scope to community organizations that work with immigrants. For the sake of this data product, we further narrowed down our scope to community organizations that work with African immigrants in the US. After several rounds of iterations, user research interviews,and feedback loops, our team created this multi-functional dashboard that depicts various trends over time. The visualizations cover a wide variety of topics from basic demographic data to high-level information on African refugees. In the future, we hope to incorporate additional groups to expand the scope of this project.

### How to use
**Tab 1: Overview**

This tab provides a high-level overview about the African-American population in the US. The various visualizations show changes in the age group composition, employment status, and education attainment for this racial group, in the past decade.

**Tab 2: Proportion of State Population**

This tab shows the proportion of the total state population that is African American, for the past decade. Between 2010 and 2020, most of the states (except for AK, DC, NY, and SC) show an increase in this proportion of the total state population.

**Tab 3: African Immigrants in the US**

This tab displays the origin country for African Immigrants to the US, by year and state, between 2010 and 2019. The dial (for the year) and the drop down menu (for the origin country) at the top of this page allow the user to interact with the visualizations and create more nuanced graphs.
The US map shows where the African immigrants reside, in any given year. Selecting (one or more) Origin Country from the drop down menu allows the user to create interesting maps about African immigrants in the US.
The barplot at the bottom shows the class of admission for the African immigrants, by origin country and year.

**Tab 4: African Refugees in the US**

The African Refugees in the US tab displays data on African refugees. Here, we want to highlight that this data is specifically for refugees and not all immigrants. Refugees are a subcategory of immigrants. This tab displays data on refugees that came to the US over the past decade.
The heatmap depicts the country of origin for the refugees. The graph under it showcases the change (from previous year) in the number of refugees entering the US.
